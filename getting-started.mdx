<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Embed basics" icon="message-square">
    Many features accept Velveta embed code. Learn the syntax in the Embeds guide.
    
    ```
    {title: Welcome!}$v{description: Hello {user.mention}!}$v{color: #00FF00}
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting Up Key Features

### Verification System

Enable verification to protect your server:

1. Run setup (automatically creates channel/roles/buttons):
   ```
   =verification setup
   ```
2. Toggle verification on/off anytime:
   ```
   =verification enable
   =verification disable
   ```

### Welcome & Farewell Messages

Create welcoming experiences for new members. Use embed code from the Embeds guide to craft rich messages. Server-specific setup commands may vary and can be managed by server staff tools.

<Info>Automated moderation and advanced workflows are roadmap features. Current release supports manual moderation via prefix commands.</Info>

## Creating Your First Embed

Let's create a welcome embed step by step:

### Step 1: Basic Structure

Start with a simple title and description:

```
{title: Welcome to our server!}$v{description: Thanks for joining {user.mention}!}
```

### Step 2: Add Color and Styling

Make it visually appealing:

```
{title: Welcome to our server!}$v{description: Thanks for joining {user.mention}!}$v{color: #00FF00}$v{thumbnail: {guild.icon}}
```

### Step 3: Add Interactive Elements

Include buttons for user actions:

```
{title: Welcome to our server!}$v{description: Thanks for joining {user.mention}!}$v{color: #00FF00}$v{thumbnail: {guild.icon}}$v{button: green && Get Verified && verify}
```

### Step 4: Test Your Embed

Post your embed in a staff-only channel or a test server before rolling it out broadly.
