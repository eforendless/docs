## Setup Guide

### Basic Setup

Get started with verification in just a few commands:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Verification Channel">
    Create a dedicated channel for verification:
    ```
  =verification setup
    ```
    
    **Channel Recommendations:**
    - Name it `#verification` or `#verify`
    - Place it at the top of your channel list
    - Set appropriate permissions (read-only for unverified)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Verification Method">
    Select your preferred verification method:
    ```
  Use the interactive buttons presented by `=verification setup` to enable/disable verification.
    ```
    
    **Method Comparison:**
    - **Phone**: Most secure, requires phone number
    - **Discord**: Good balance, uses account analysis
    - **CAPTCHA**: Bot prevention, quick verification
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Roles">
    Set up verified and unverified roles:
    ```
  Roles are created automatically when enabling verification (Verified/Unverified). You can rename them later.
    ```
    
    **Role Setup Tips:**
    - Create roles if they don't exist
    - Set appropriate permissions
    - Consider role colors for visibility
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the System">
    Test verification with an alt account:
    ```
  Use `=verify` in the verification channel to receive your verification link if DM fails.
    ```
    
    Ensure the process works smoothly before going live.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced Configuration

#### Custom Welcome Messages

Create personalized verification messages:

Welcome and follow-up messages can be configured via the verification settings and embed system. Use the `=embed` premium commands to create rich messages and reference them in your welcome/verification channels.

**Message Features:**
- Custom embed styling
- Server branding
- Multiple languages
- Interactive buttons

#### Verification Timeouts

Set time limits for verification completion:

Admins may configure timeouts and kick actions for unverified users using server settings. If supported in your build, consult the moderation/logs setup.

**Timeout Options:**
- **Duration**: 1h to 7d
- **Actions**: kick, ban, or role removal
- **Warnings**: Send reminders before timeout

#### Role Management

Advanced role configuration:

Verified and Unverified roles are managed automatically on enable. Advanced role routing can be handled through moderation automations and welcome flows.

**Role Types:**
- **Verified**: Roles added after successful verification
- **Unverified**: Roles for users awaiting verification
- **Temporary**: Roles during verification process
