## Quick Fixes

### Bot Not Responding

Most common issue with simple solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Bot Status">
    **Verify the bot is online:**
    - Look for the bot in your member list
    - Check if it shows as online (green dot)
  - Try an AI or token command: `/tokens` or `/premium status`
    
    **If bot appears offline:**
    - Check [status page](https://status.velvetaai.com)
    - Wait 5-10 minutes for reconnection
    - Contact support if issue persists
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission Issues">
    **Essential Bot Permissions:**
    - Send Messages
    - Embed Links  
    - Add Reactions
    - Use Slash Commands
    - Manage Messages (for moderation)
    - Manage Roles (for verification)
    
    **How to check permissions:**
    1. Right-click the bot in member list
    2. Select "Roles" 
    3. Verify the bot role has required permissions
    4. Ensure bot role is above target roles
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slash Commands Not Working">
    **Common causes and fixes:**
    
    **Commands not appearing:**
    - Wait 5-10 minutes after bot invite
    - Re-invite bot with updated permissions
    - Check server integration settings
    
    **Commands appear but don't work:**
    - Verify bot has "Use Slash Commands" permission
    - Check channel-specific permission overrides
    - Try using commands in different channels
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Command Issues

### Slash Commands

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commands Not Appearing">
    **Troubleshooting steps:**
    
    1. **Wait for sync:** Discord can take up to 1 hour to sync commands
    2. **Check permissions:** Bot needs "Use Slash Commands" permission
    3. **Re-invite bot:** Use updated invite link with correct permissions
    4. **Clear Discord cache:** 
       - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
       - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
    
  If commands still don't appear after an hour, re-invite the bot with Application Commands scope.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Command Errors">
    **Common error messages:**
    
    **"This interaction failed"**
    - Bot may be experiencing high latency
    - Try the command again in a few seconds
    - Check bot status page
    
    **"Missing permissions"**
    - Bot lacks required permissions for the action
    - Check role hierarchy and permissions
    - Verify channel-specific overrides
    
    **"Invalid user/channel/role"**
    - Mentioned user/channel/role doesn't exist
    - Check spelling and availability
    - Ensure you have permission to mention targets
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow Response Times">
    **Optimization tips:**
    
    **Server-side issues:**
    - High Discord API latency
    - Database connection delays
    - Heavy server load
    
    **Check response time:**
    ```
    /ping
    ```
    
    **If consistently slow (>5 seconds):**
    - Report to support with server ID
    - Include command and timestamp
    - Provide screenshot of `/ping` results
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Prefix Commands

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prefix Not Working">
  **Default prefix:** `=`
    
    **Common issues:**
    - Using wrong prefix (`!` vs `v!`)
    - Extra spaces (`v! ping` vs `v!ping`)
    - Autocorrect changing prefix
    
  If your server changed the prefix, ask an admin for the configured value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Arguments Not Recognized">
    **Proper command formatting:**
    
  **Correct:**
  ```
  =warn 123456789012345678 This is the reason
  =ban 123456789012345678 Spam messages
  ```
    
  **Incorrect:**
  ```
  =warn user reason  (missing ID/mention)
  =ban @user "reason" (quotes not required)
  ```
    
    **Multi-word arguments:**
    - Use spaces normally, no quotes needed
    - Bot automatically handles multi-word reasons
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Embed Issues

### Embeds Not Displaying

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission Problems">
    **Required permissions:**
    - Send Messages
    - Embed Links
    - View Channel
    
    **Check embed permissions:**
    1. Go to Channel Settings → Permissions
    2. Find your bot role
    3. Ensure "Embed Links" is enabled (green checkmark)
    4. Check for red X's that might override
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Syntax Errors">
    **Common embed syntax mistakes:**
    
    **Missing separators:**
    ```
    ❌ {title: Hello}{description: World}
    ✅ {title: Hello}$v{description: World}
    ```
    
    **Unmatched braces:**
    ```
    ❌ {title: Hello World
    ✅ {title: Hello World}
    ```
    
    **Invalid colors:**
    ```
    ❌ {color: blue}
    ✅ {color: #0000FF}
    ```
    
  Post in a staff-only test channel to verify formatting before sending broadly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Variable Issues">
    **Variable troubleshooting:**
    
    **Variables not working:**
    - Check variable spelling: `{user}` not `{username}`
    - Ensure proper context: `{guild.name}` only works in servers
    - Variables are case-sensitive
    
  Test variables by posting in a server channel so context (user/guild) is available.
    
    **Common variables:**
    - `{user}` - User's display name
    - `{user.mention}` - @mention user
    - `{guild.name}` - Server name
    - `{channel.name}` - Channel name
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Button Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Buttons Not Working">
    **Button syntax check:**
    ```
    ✅ {button: green && Click Me && custom_id}
    ❌ {button: green & Click Me & custom_id}
    ```
    
    **Required elements:**
    - Button style (green, blue, red, grey, link)
    - Button label (text displayed)
    - Custom ID or URL (for functionality)
    
    **Button limitations:**
    - Maximum 5 buttons per row
    - Maximum 25 total buttons per message
    - Custom ID must be unique
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Button Interactions Failing">
    **Common causes:**
    
    **Interaction timeout:**
    - Buttons expire after 15 minutes
    - Restart bot to refresh interactions
    
    **Missing handlers:**
    - Bot may not have handler for custom ID
    - Check button custom ID spelling
    - Report unknown custom IDs to support
    
    **Permission issues:**
    - Bot needs permission to respond
    - Check channel permissions for bot
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Verification Issues

### Users Can't Verify

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verification Portal Problems">
    **Portal not loading:**
    - Check if verification is properly setup
    - Verify web portal is accessible
    - Clear browser cache and cookies
    - Try different browser or device
    
  If setup seems incomplete, re-run:
  ```
  =verification setup
  ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phone Verification Issues">
    **Common phone verification problems:**
    
    **SMS not received:**
    - Check phone number format (+1234567890)
    - Verify carrier supports SMS
    - Check spam/blocked messages
    - Wait 5-10 minutes for delivery
    
    **Invalid phone number:**
    - Must include country code
    - No spaces or special characters
    - Landlines may not work
    - VoIP numbers often blocked
    
  If a user didn’t receive the link in DM, have them run `=verify` in the verification channel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Discord Verification Failing">
    **Account analysis issues:**
    
    **Account too new:**
    - Minimum age requirements not met
    - Adjust settings or use manual review
    
    **Missing profile elements:**
    - No custom avatar
    - Empty bio/about section

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Role Assignment Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Roles Not Being Added">
    **Role hierarchy check:**
    - Bot role must be above verification roles
