> Tips
- Include a clear reason; it will be shown to staff and in logs where applicable.
- Make sure the bot's role is above the target user's highest role.
- You need appropriate Discord permissions: Kick Members, Ban Members, or Moderate Members.

## Verification Integration

Combine moderation with the verification system for safer onboarding.

```
=verification setup
```

Then toggle as needed:

```
=verification enable
=verification disable
```

See the Verification guide for details: [/discord/verification](/discord/verification)

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be clear and consistent">
    Document your rules and apply them consistently. Include specific reasons with every action.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use appropriate durations">
    Reserve long timeouts or bans for repeated or severe violations. Start with a warn or short timeout when appropriate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check permissions">
    Ensure the bot role is above target users and has Kick, Ban, and Moderate Members permissions.
